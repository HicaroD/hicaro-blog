                Hello, everyone! My name is <b>Hícaro Dânrlley</b> and I'm a <b>Computer Science student </b>
                and a <b>software developer</b>. I started my
                journey in coding three years ago with C programming language.
                Actually, at first, I wanted to be a lawyer, but a great friend of mine told me about
                a Harvard course called <a href="https://www.edx.org/cs50">CS50</a> and
                that changed my life forever (Thanks, Alice ♥).
                Ever since, I've been writing software in multiple programming languages,
                such as Python, Dart, Go, JavaScript and more.
            </p>
            <br></br>

                Nowadays I work as a Flutter developer. In my spare time, I like writing open source
                software, especially software for improving the productivity of other developers.
                I would love to contribue to other open source projects, so I can help the community while
                improving my skills.
            </p>
